\section{Bank Lending MDP}
We define the following state space:
$$\mathbf{S} = \{ (c,w_d,t) | c, w_d \in \mathbb{R}, t\in \mathbb{N}, t \leq T\} $$
where $c$ is the cash at disposable of the bank, $w_d$ are deferred withdrawals that are backlogged from previous incapacity to pay and $t$ is the day number.\\

We denote $k(c) = K\text{cot}\frac{\pi c}{2C}$ the penalty for $c < C$ to simplify notation and have $r\in\mathbb{R}, r>0]$ a random variable denoting the return on the investment (so 0 is the investment becomes worthless) and $d\in\mathbb{R}$ is the random variable denoting the net deposit from clients (negative $d$ denotes net withdrawals). Then for any given state $s = (c,w_d,r)$ we have the action set:
$$ \mathbf{A} = \{ (b,i) | i \in [0,c - \tilde{k}(c)]\, b\in [0, \frac{(c-i-\tilde{k}(c))}{R}\}$$
where $b$ is the amount of cash borrowed by the bank and $i$ is the amount of cash invested in the risky asset. The transition is then defined by the probability distribution of the tuple $(c', w_d',t+1)$ where $c', w_d'$ are random variables defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
c' = \begin{cases} c-bR+ir -w_d + d &\text{ if $c-bR+ir-w_d \geq C$}\\ \max\{0, c-bR+ir+d-w_d -k(c-bR+ir+d)\} & \text{ otherwise}\end{cases}\\
w_d' = \begin{cases} 0 &\text{ if $c-bR+ir-w_d \geq C$} \\ - \min\{0, c-bR+ir+d-w_d -k(c-bR+ir+d)\}& \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}\\
\end{align*}
Finally the reward function is pretty straight forward looking only at the net Utility of assets minus liabilities at the end of the horizon:
$$ \mathbf{R}( (c,w_d, t)) =  \begin{cases} c-w_d &\text{ if $t=T$}\\ 0 & \text{ otherwise}\end{cases}$$

Since this clearly involves some rather intricate (stepwise functions) compositions of random variables and functions, this will likely require approximate dynamic programming to solve.

\section{Milk Vendor MDP}
We compute:
\begin{align*}
g(S) &= p\cdot g_1(S) + h g_2(S)\\
&= p\cdot \int_{S}^{\infty} (x-S)f(x)dx+ h \int_{-\infty}^S (S-x)f(x)dx\\
&= p \int_{S}^{\infty}xf(x)dx-pS\int_{S}^{\infty}f(x)dx- h \int_{-\infty}^Sxf(x)dx + hS\int_{-\infty}^Sf(x)dx\\
\end{align*}
Taking the derivative hence yields:

\begin{align*}
g'(S) &= -pSf(S)-p\int_{S}^{\infty}f(x)dx + pSf(S) - h Sf(S) + hSf(S)+h\int_{-\infty}^Sf(x)dx\\
&= -p(1-F(S)) +hF(S)\\
\end{align*}
and setting it to zero to find an extremum gives:
$$ F(S) = \frac{p}{h+p}$$
So the solution is the $S$ that satisfies the above (this exists since the the cumulative function $F$ is monotone increasing and is surjective onto $[0,1]$.\\

Looking at the payout structure suggests we can think of the milkman as having to choose a strike from which he will get long $p$ units of calls and $h$ units of puts where the underlying the demand for milk.

\section{American Option Pricing}
The American Option Markov Decision Process is written up in optimal\_american\_option.py. We perform approximate dynamic programming using a linear function approximation who's features essentially approximate the value of the option as a cubic function of the strike price.

We test it out with the standard log normal distribution and find intuitively meaning full results, notably that the option is exercised starting at higher and higher strikes as time closes in, something that we know to be true from the binomial approximation.
